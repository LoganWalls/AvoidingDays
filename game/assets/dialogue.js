		"I finally found you! It’s been awhile since school hasn’t it? I tried visiting you at the company that you told me took you on, but they were very confused when I asked for you.\
		 <i>You liar.</i> The HR manager barely even remembered your name! <i>How pathetic is that!?</i>",
		"I went looking for you, but your family was hard to get a hold of and they hadn’t heard from you in a long time either. \
		<i>Even though they haven’t even tried because of how ashamed they are of you.</i> They are worried about you. Do you want to go see them? <i>So I can rub your failures in their face?</i>",
		"Hey, I brought some food. It’s not much, but it doesn't seem like you are eating too well. <i>How pathetic are you to not even eat right?</i>\
		 Do you have time, or should I just leave it here? <i>Like the rest of the trash here?</i>",
		 "It’s been so long since we last sat down like this. What happened to the good old days? It’s like we graduated school and entered completely different worlds. <i>I ended up being a success of course.</i>\
		 Sometimes I wonder if it’s really even you. Do you want to go to that bar we used to hit up where you got turned down by the server? <i>I’d love to see her reaction to you showing back up now!</i>",
		 "Hey! I have great news, a tech company is hiring! They want applicants with a Masters degree and 4 years work experience in a related field <i>which you don’t have</i>, but that’s usually just rubbish right?\
		  You should apply! <i>It will be a huge waste of time and really funny!</i>",
		  "Do you have a minuet? <i>Of course you do!</i> I just got a promotion at work and I wanted to <i>brag</i> celebrate! Some of my coworkers will be there too. They are all really fun people, making me laugh <i>at you</i> all the time.",
		  "Have you thought about going back to school and getting that degree you were talking about? <i>I mean what else are you doing with your waste of a life?</i> Maybe now is a good time to start?",
		  "Don’t you want to meet new people? <i>So you can lie to them until they find out what you are really like and abandon you.</i> A stranger is just a friend that you haven’t met yet!",
		  "I saw you family the other day. They wanted me to let you know that you can come home. <i>They can’t stand the thought of people finding out about you.</i> They are worried about <i>ashamed of</i> you.",
		  "Am I the only one who has come to visit you? <i>Am I wasting my time trying to reconnect with you?</i>",
		  "The store down the street is hiring! It’s only part time too! <i>So after taxes you’ll end up losing money AND have to interact with people who will hate you!</i> It’s a win-win!",
		  "Are you getting enjoyment from living this way? <i>Does this give you meaning and fulfillment?</i> What would you rather be doing?",

	"Hikkikomori(Shut in Syndrome) is a growing phenomenon that affects hundreds of thousands of people across the world. While prevalent in Japan and South Korea, there are reported cases of incidents occurring worldwide -with more reported every year. \
	It is usually triggered by an event relating to some form of rejection or a lack of being treated like a person. As a result many of these people are unable to accept the kindness of those close to them, and rarely encounter others who would think to treat them with dignity. \
	Direct statistics are exceedingly hard to track because of the reclusive behavior exhibited by sufferers of this condition, and the fact that many families look to keep them hidden out of fear for their family's reputation.\
	No one who is “Hikkikomori” is happy with how they are living their life, but they generally are unable to see a way out of their situation. They turn to numbing themselves emotionally as a way of protecting themselves -caught \
	in an endless cycle of existing “outside the norm” with no way they can see to forge ahead. Being seen for who they are, not what they have done seems to be one of the largest factors in enabling them to reintegrate into society.\
	This phenomenon shows the impact of the growing trend in our society to view people as a set of neat numbers and categories, rather than individuals. In some ways this kind of shift might seem inevitable: as our population grows, efficiency demands we make fast decisions \
	about people whom we know nothing about. But the phenomenon of Hikkikomori suggests that perhaps there is another, more personal element we are beginning to neglect. Through the pursuit of efficiency we too not see a person for their potential, and through that lack of \
	acknowledgement deny not only who they are, but also who they can become in an instant. In most cases one person can make all of the difference between someone retreating away from the world and taking that first difficult step back into it.",

	generally been treated as superficial: flimsy substitutes for face-to-face interaction at best, insincere connections contributing to social decline at worst. However, as the population of connected people has grown across the planet and the expressiveness of online communication \
	has increased, perhaps it is time to revisit our initial judgements about these connections. We are entering an age where what people gain from their experiences may need to be used as the bases of value instead of a factor for determining it. This is supported by the many cases \
	where the value of strong relationships, regardless of the medium, have helped build a person's self worth and give them the courage to face the world.",
